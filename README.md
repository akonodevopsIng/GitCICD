## Overview

This repository contains Terraform files to manage infrastructure as well as a YAML file to configure the CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure includes resources such as VPCs, subnets, gateways, and security groups.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Terraform]
- [Git]
- [An AWS account]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable).

## Usage

### Terraform Configuration

2. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review the execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the changes:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### CI/CD

The CI/CD YAML file is configured to automate the deployment of the infrastructure. Ensure your CI/CD environment is set up to execute Terraform commands. Hereâ€™s an example of what your YAML file might look like:

```yaml
# Example YAML file for CI/CD
name: Terraform CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.0.0

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
